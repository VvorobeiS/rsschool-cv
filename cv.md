## About me

I work for a digital agency. I am a junior frontend developer.

Prior to that, he worked in another company as a project manager, where he was also involved in front-end development of the project.

At the moment I know how to layout well and write simple constructions in js. There are plans for a deeper study of js, for further study of the Vue and Angular frameworks.

Unfortunately, at the moment I have a problems with the English language. Which I also plan to fix.
